# 548. Intersection of Two Arrays II

## Description

Given two arrays, write a function to compute their intersection.

```
Each element in the result should appear as many times as it shows in both arrays.
The result can be in any order.
```



**Example**
```
Given nums1 = [1, 2, 2, 1], nums2 = [2, 2], return [2, 2].
```
**Challenge**

* What if the given array is already sorted? How would you optimize your algorithm?
* What if nums1's size is small compared to num2's size? Which algorithm is better?
* What if elements of nums2 are stored on disk, and the memory is limited such that you cannot load all elements into the memory at once?
